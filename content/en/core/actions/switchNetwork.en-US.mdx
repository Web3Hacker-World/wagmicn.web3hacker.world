# switchNetwork

Action for switching networks with a connector.

```ts
import { switchNetwork } from '@wagmi/core'
```

## Usage

Some wallet apps do not support programmatic network switching and `switchNetwork` will throw an error, `SwitchChainNotSupportedError`. For those situations, you can typically switch networks in the wallet app and wagmi will stay up-to-date.

```ts
import { switchNetwork } from '@wagmi/core'

const network = await switchNetwork({
  chainId: 1,
})
```

## Return Value

```ts
Chain
```

## Configuration

### chainId

Chain id to switch to.

```ts {4}
import { switchNetwork } from '@wagmi/core'

const network = await switchNetwork({
  chainId: 69,
})
```
