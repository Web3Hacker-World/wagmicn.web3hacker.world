# watchPublicClient

Action for subscribing to [PublicClient](/core/actions/getPublicClient) changes.

```ts
import { watchPublicClient } from '@wagmi/core'
```

## Usage

By default, the callback will be invoked when Public Client changes.

```ts
import { watchPublicClient } from '@wagmi/core'

const unwatch = watchPublicClient(
  {
    chainId: 1,
  },
  (publicClient) => console.log(publicClient),
)
```

## Return Value

`unwatch` is a function that can be called to unsubscribe from the Public Client change event.

## Configuration

### chainId (optional)

Force a specific chain id for the Public Client. The wagmi `Client`'s `publicClient` must be set up as a [chain-aware function](/core/config#publicclient-optional) for this to work correctly.

```ts {5}
import { watchPublicClient } from '@wagmi/core'

const unwatch = watchPublicClient(
  {
    chainId: 1,
  },
  (publicClient) => console.log(publicClient),
)
```
