### `BigInt` Serialization

Using native `BigInt` with `JSON.stringify` will raise a `TypeError` as
`BigInt` values are not serializable. [Read more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt#use_within_json).

There are two techniques to mitigate this:

#### Lossless serialization

Lossless serialization means that `BigInt` will be converted to a format that can be deserialized later (e.g. `69420n` → `"#bigint.69420"`). The trade-off is that these values are not human-readable and are not intended to be displayed to the user.

Lossless serialization can be achieved with wagmi's `serialize` & `deserialize`

```tsx
import { serialize, deserialize } from 'wagmi'

const serialized = serialize({ value: 69420n })
// '{"value":"#bigint.69420"}'

const deserialized = deserialize(serialized)
// { value: 69420n }
```

#### Lossy serialization

Lossy serialization means that the `BigInt` will be converted to a normal display string (e.g. `69420n` → `"69420"`).
The trade-off is that you will not be able to deserialize the `BigInt` with `JSON.parse` as it can not distinguish between a normal string and a `BigInt`.

This method can be achieved by modifying `JSON.stringify` to include a BigInt `replacer`:

```tsx
const replacer = (key, value) =>
  typeof value === 'bigint' ? value.toString() : value

JSON.stringify({ value: 69420n }, replacer)
// '{"value":"69420"}'
```
