# watchPendingTransactions

Action for subscribing to pending transactions in the RPC Provider's transaction [mempool](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-a-mempool).

This is a wrapper around viem's [`watchPendingTransactions`](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/public/watchPendingTransactions.html).

```ts
import { watchPendingTransactions } from '@wagmi/core'
```

<Callout>
  Only RPC Providers that support the `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter` method
  will work with this Action.
</Callout>

## Usage

The callback will be invoked when a new transactions enters the memory pool of the RPC Provider.

```ts
import { watchPendingTransactions } from '@wagmi/core'

const unwatch = watchPendingTransactions({}, (transactions) =>
  console.log(transactions),
)
```

## Return Value

`unwatch` is a function that can be called to unsubscribe from the pending transactions event.

## Configuration

### chainId (optional)

Force a specific chain id for the request. The wagmi `Client`'s `publicClient` must be set up as a [chain-aware function](/core/config#publicclient-optional) for this to work correctly.

```ts {5}
import { watchPendingTransactions } from '@wagmi/core'

const unwatch = watchPendingTransactions(
  {
    chainId: 1,
  },
  (transaction) => console.log(transaction),,
)
```
